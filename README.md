# 🎨 Random Color Generator

> A minimal, zero-dependency color generator built with vanilla web technologies — demonstrating core frontend fundamentals with clean, intentional code.

## 🚀 Overview

This project generates a **random RGB color** on user interaction and applies it as the page background while displaying the exact color code. Built entirely with **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**, it reflects a strong grasp of:

- DOM manipulation
- Event-driven programming
- Encapsulation and scope management
- Responsive UI design

Perfect for beginners to understand how dynamic web experiences are created **without frameworks**.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Dynamic RGB Color Generation**: Creates a new valid RGB color on every click.
- **Real-time Visual Feedback**: Page background updates instantly to reflect the generated color.
- **Clean & Readable UI**: Color code displayed in a centered, shadowed card with smooth hover effects.
- **Zero External Dependencies**: No libraries, build tools, or frameworks — just pure web standards.
- **Encapsulated Logic**: Uses **IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)** to avoid global scope pollution and ensure modular code structure.
- **Mobile-Responsive Layout**: Works seamlessly on all screen sizes using Flexbox.
